# FIT2014-Theory-of-computation
This unit introduces formal languages, models of computation, and computational complexity. Topics include finite state automata, regular expressions, grammars, pushdown automata, computable functions, Turing machines, polynomial-time reductions, complexity classes P and NP, and NP-completeness.

Assignment 1: Linux tools, regular expressions, induction
Assignment 2: Regular Languages, Context-Free Languages, Lexical analysis, Parsing, Turing machines (using Tuatara) and Quaternions
